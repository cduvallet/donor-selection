This local folder contains metabolomics data from healthy stool 
donors included in the Broad Next 10. The file is too large
to be pushed to github and so is only available locally.

After the BN10 resource paper is published, this file will be
available publicly. I will edit the code in this repo to point
to that file.

Claire received these raw data from Julian Pacheco on Nov 2, 2018
from personal communication.
