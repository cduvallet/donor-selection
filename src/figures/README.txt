This directory contains the notebooks used to generate
the figures in the paper.

Note that running 'make' doesn't change the content of these
notebooks, so if there are discrepancies between the final
figures in the `final/figures/` folder and these notebooks,
the figures in the folder are correct. (To make them match,
you should open these notebooks and re-run them from
within a notebook).
